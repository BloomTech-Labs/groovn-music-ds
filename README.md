## Project Overview

1️⃣ [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/wRlpwQHc/groovn-music)

1️⃣ [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/fa46a4ff908642fa9c7011e5c1342f6f?v=4dfdf951ee6845c0be6a536d4fb124e7)

The purpose of this project to build a data science recommendation system that generate new song according to previous user's preferences.

Music Recommendation API

1. What Feature(s) is/are this API connected to?

    Music Recommendation

2. What will this API integration accomplish in the feature(s) to which it’s connected?

    The Python API web server will host a data model that can perform on-demand prediction for similar songs that user may like. The result data can retrieved through GET and POST function.

3. What alternatives did you consider?

    Pre-populate prediction for popular songs and store them within playlists inside a database

4. Why did you decide on this solution? (what are the advantages?)

    The recommendation will be on-demand and result will be dynamic. This also provides more flexibility when updating to newer predictive model.

5. What are the potential challenges can you foresee?

    The time to retrieve recommendation may take longer due to server limitation.

### Tech Stack

1. HTTP Web server and Web Applications

- Gunicorn
    - Automatic worker process management
    - Multiple worker configurations
    - Light on server resources and fairly fast
- Flask
    - Lightweight and extensible Python web framework
    - Extensions available to enhance additional features

2. Heroku Infrastructure

- Pickle for model deployment

- REST API with the Flask Framework

- Heroku Pipelines to maintain continuous workflow

### 2️⃣ Predictions

- Sklearn or XGBoost package to predict user’s music preference based on regression or neighbors-based learning methods

- Pandas, Numpy, and other Anaconda scientific packages for data analysis

### Data Sources

-   [Project Data](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/groovn-music-ds/tree/master/data)
-   [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/)
